# HLA Toolkit

This is the initial prototype version of the High Level Architecture (HLA) Toolkit. It currently
provides the following capabilities:

* Editor for HLA Federated Object Model (FOM)
* Editor for HLA Object Model Template (OMT)
* Cross validation with code completion & type visiting
* Minimal error checking
* Generates an HLA Federate that logs all interaction and object updates

Currently the plugins have to be incorporated into an Eclipse IDE to be executed. Work is currently underway to configure
this project as a P2 repository available for installation into Eclipse IDEs.
