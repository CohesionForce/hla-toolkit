# Federation settings for the AFMSTT federation.

# This implementation assumes that the RTI_RID_FILE environment variable
# has been set to point RTI-s to the URL that holds the AFMSTT.rid file.
# RTI-s also uses this URL to find the FOM modules.  Note that RTI-s does
# not allow spaces in any path values, and this often causes problems on
# Windows systems.
